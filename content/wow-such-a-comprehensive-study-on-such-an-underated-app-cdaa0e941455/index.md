Wow, such a comprehensive study on such an underated app! Many people use this app on the daily, but very few dares to use this app as a study of UX. I love your solutions and how you used guerilla method to do 'rapid research’. But the last one seem off to me, would changing the placeholder of the input box from “search station” to “type your station”, alter the users to type rather than scroll? If you think about some cases, users tend to use this app when they’re on the station waiting for trains, or they’re planning for a trip. And on those 2 occasions, the use of one finger (thumb) to scroll will likely be the user’s first action.

My solution for this would be to take note of how Grab and Gojek app (or any ridesharing app really) do when the users want to search for destination, which is to use gps to find some places (in this case, station) that are closest to the current location and display it. Although we must acknowledge that not all users that are searching for stations are located near the respected ones, but such method will make the user flow easier, thus making the users need less typing nor scrolling.

Cheers.
